## üîß Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Step 1: Clone and Setup
```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir cuisine_recommender
cd cuisine_recommender

# Save the app.py file and create templates directory
mkdir templates

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Save Files
1. Save the main application code as `app.py`
2. Create the `templates` directory
3. Save the HTML templates in the templates directory:
   - `base.html`
   - `index.html` 
   - `dashboard.html`

### Step 3: Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:5000`

## üéØ Usage Guide

### 1. Main Interface (`/`)
- **Select User**: Choose from 100 pre-generated user profiles (ID 1-100)
- **View Profile**: See user preferences, spice tolerance, and rating history
- **Mood Selection**: Get recommendations based on current mood:
  - Adventurous: Complex, challenging cuisines
  - Comfort Food: Familiar, low-spice options
  - Spicy: High spice level cuisines
  - Healthy: Vegetarian-friendly, nutritious options

### 2. Recommendation Methods
- **Hybrid (Recommended)**: Best of both collaborative and content-based (60/40 weight)
- **Collaborative**: Recommendations based on similar users' preferences
- **Content-Based**: Recommendations based on cuisine feature similarity
- **Popular**: Top-rated cuisines for new users

### 3. Interactive Rating
- Click "Rate This Cuisine" on any recommendation
- Provide 1-5 star ratings
- System updates recommendations in real-time
